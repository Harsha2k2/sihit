# Cryptographic Algorithm Identifier

we use to identify cryptographic algorithms from given datasets using machine learning techniques and if u get a doubt how we use c++ to identify crypto algorithms then we are using mlpack library for machine learning techniques and arma::mat for matrix operations. and an api call from nn.transformers.py to get embeddings of the data and then we are doing some feature engineering and then training a neural network to identify the cryptographic algorithm (good luck mate).
